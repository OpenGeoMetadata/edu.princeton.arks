    <field name="dc_title_s">Tuolumne County, California land parcels, 2008</field>
    <field name="dc_description_s">Based on original Tuolumne County cadastral parcel data, which was digitized and rubbersheeted using Manatron software and assessors' record of survey maps starting in 1992, this feature class was spatially adjusted in ARCINFO Workstation using ARCEDIT in late 2002 to reflect more accurate locational data. This is the first generation of the overall spatially corrected parcel data.As a basic building block for county-wide analyses and mapping, the parcel feature class needed to be more spatially correct. Although continually updated, the original digital parcel data varied from plus/minus a few feet to plus/minus 1000 feet in locational accuracy. The County of Tuolumne cannot guarantee relatibility or suitability of this information. Original data was compiled from a variety of sources, and the spatial information has variable accuracy. The dataset is subject to routine and occasional updating, correcting, and other modification without notification.

From Camden's topographical and historical survey, Britannia, originally published with a set of county maps in the Latin edition of 1607. The principal source of the maps of the 1607 edition were the maps of Saxton, Norden and Mercator, with the bulk of the engraving undertaken by William Kip (fl. 1598-1635) and William Hole (fl. 1600-1646). The first English edition (translated by Philamon Holland) was printed in 1610 with maps printed from the same plates. Two successive alterations were made to the plates before 1622 (including the addition of plate nos. to all but 14 of the maps), possibly in preparation for the second edition (not actually published until 1637, but entered at Stationer's Hall in 1625). Latin text on verso with caption title: Brechnock-shire; p. 479, 482; signature Ttt. Shows county boundaries, lakes, rivers, woods, parks and settlements. Relief shown pictorially. In top right-hand corner, a plain cartouche enclosing the title. Scale bar graded [0]-5; enclosed by cartouche.",

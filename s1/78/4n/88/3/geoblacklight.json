Each segment has caption title,Tabulae Peutingerianae segmentum, numbered from 1-8, with indication of cities at beginning and end of road segment. From: Theatrum geographiæ veteris, duobus tomis distinctum / edente Petro Bertio Bevero ... Amstelodami : Ex officina Iudoci Hondij, 1619 . \"Ortelius knew about the existence of a series of manuscript road maps, showing the Roman view of the world at around the third century. The original ... came into the hands of Konrad Peutinger (1465-1547) and later went to his relative Mark Welser. Welser was the first to publish a copy of it in 1591 ... Ortelius found this copy inadequate. Therefore, in 1598 new manuscript copies were made at his request by Welser. The present set of eight plates on four sheets were engraved following these copies ... Bertius included these prints in his Theatrum geographiae veteris without text, but with geographical indication per strip in 1619.\"--Broecke, M.P.R. van den, Ortelius atlas maps.",

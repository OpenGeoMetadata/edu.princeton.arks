Distinctions are made between principal cities, large towns and villages including hamlets but all are named, the larger and more important in capital letters. Roads are also classified between main postal routes, roads that are not postal routes, main and subsidiary roads, good roads and poor roads. A classification key is provided. Each leg of the road is also marked with a number showing the distance in French lieues [i.e. roughly equivalent to English leagues or about 3 miles] between two settlements. The map extends north to show the most direct route across the English south coast to Londres [i.e. London]. Relief is not shown. Towns and cities are in their correct geographic positions, but the roads are schematic, indicated by straight lines with distances shown. Historic Maps copy has ms. note: Achetée en 1822.",

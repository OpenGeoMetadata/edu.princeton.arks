Iesso, Yezo, or Hokkaido, was explored by Maarten Gerritzoon Vries in 1643, and was conjectured to be part of America; it first appeared on Baudraud's world map of 1658. California was first shown as an island by William Grent in 1625; in 1700 it reverted to its correct peninsular shape on the world map of De L'Isle. cf. Shirley, R. The mapping of the world.",

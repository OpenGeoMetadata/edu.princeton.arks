  "dc_description_s": "Official population and housing data for Nicaragua from the 2005 census. This census is provided at the barrio administrative level (ADM4) and includes 8,136 polygons with 352 attribute variables. Attribute descriptions retain native-language names and unique identifier codes. All variable names were translated from native language (Spanish). Field name prefixes, originally written with coded titles, were renamed to create unique names across the geodatabase (e.g. Original variable of “Miembro Del Hogar Falleció Desde El 1 De Enero De 2004: Si” was updated to D001 and given the alias “Member Of The Household Has Died Since January 1st 2004: Yes[Miembro Del Hogar Falleció Desde El 1 De Enero De 2004: Si]”, the letter D was given as it relates to the Demographic theme table. D = Demographic, E = Economic, H = Housing, M = Migration, S = Social and T = Transportation). All variables from the original data were reviewed for completeness and organized into their relevant themes of Demographic, Economic, Housing, Migration, Social and Transportation. The geodatabase was built to hold these specific tables with all geographic names and codes represented as text fields and census data represented as doubles or long integers. Automated tools were run to apply aliases in the format “English translation field description[Native language field description]”. Vector data was analyzed for accuracy and compared with national boundaries.",

    "Map shows the old city of Paris and successive extensions of the agglomeration. Six time periods are noted: before 1805, 1805-1857, 1857-1887, 1887-1908, 1908-1936, and 1936-1965. Map offers panoramic view of the parisian region: physical aspects of the territory, the urban structure, transportation routes, population movements and structures. In lower left corner: A.U.R.E.G."

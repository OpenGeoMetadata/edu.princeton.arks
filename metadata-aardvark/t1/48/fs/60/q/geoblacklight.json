    "This dataset shows land excluded from the siting of solar photovoltaic candidate project areas (CPAs) in the contiguous United States to 2050 under all net-zero-emissions scenarios with more permissive land-use assumptions. Exclusions based on considerations of techno-economic factors, environment and conservation, prime soils, and slope are shown separately. For an overview of the \"base\" land-use assumptions on which this dataset is predicated, please refer to the \"supplemental information\" portion of this record."

    "World Latitude and Longitude Grids represents a 5 by 5 degree latitude/longitude grid covering the world with attributes that allow you to display grids at intervals of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 degrees. To display a grid with a 5-degree interval, simply display all of the lines. To display a coarser grid, for example, a 15-degree interval, define the theme properties as lines with the Degree15 attribute equal to Y."

    "Relief shown by contours and gradient tints. Depths shown by bathymetric tints, isolines and soundings. Supposed outline of Antarctica according to Murray is shown. Conjectural sections of coast shown by broken lines. \"The Principal Explorers' Routes within South Polar Regions are marked in Red, thus showing what is ascertained, and what is hypothetical.\" Primary map includes inset maps of Victoria Land and of Graham Land, South Shetland Islands, and South Orkney Islands. Secondary maps show composition of benthic sediment, limits of pack and floating ice, temperature, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, winds, and magnetic phenomena. From: Geographical Journal. Vol. 3, no. 1 (Jan. 1894), pages 1-42; held in Firestone Library. Call number: G7 .J6874"

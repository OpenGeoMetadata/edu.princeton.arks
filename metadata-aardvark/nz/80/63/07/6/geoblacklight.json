    "These are digital boundaries for the system of burghs and districts of county essentially created by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 and continuing to exist until 1975. Scotland was divided into Cities, Large Burghs, Small Burghs and Districts of County (with the exception of the counties of Kinross and Nairn, whose rural areas were not subdivided). These units generally functioned as sub-divisions of Scottish Counties with powers varying according to status, but the four Cities had full independence from the County they were situated within. This file represents the system as it was used to report the 1951 Census of Population."

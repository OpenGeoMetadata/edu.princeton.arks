    "Relief shown by hachures. Base map depicting eastern Virignia printed in brown ink. \"Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1862 by L. Prang & Co.\" \"Explanations. The extraordinary large scale on which this map is drawn has been adopted to make it just what we designed it to be, namely 1st. The most distinct map ever published of the whole Virginia territory, where the decisive battles for the Union will be fought. 2nd. A marking map, that is a map to mark the change of positions of the Union forces in red pencil and the rebel forces in blue, on the receipt of every telegram from the seat of war . . .\" In this issue, Hixford, Virginia, south of Petersburg, has been changed to Hicksford. Description derived from published bibliography. Shows roads and railroads from Hagerstown, Md., south to Suffolk, Va., and west to Staunton, Va."

    "This dataset shows the carbon dioxide (CO2) trunk pipelines in the contiguous United States that will be required by 2050 to connect CO2 spur pipelines to CO2 storage basins under a net-zero-emissions scenario with high biomass supply. For an overview of this \"E-B+\" high-biomass scenario, please refer to the \"supplemental information\" portion of this record."

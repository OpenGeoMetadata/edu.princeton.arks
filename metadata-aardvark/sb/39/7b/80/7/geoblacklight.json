    "Relief shown pictorially. Dedication: To His Grace John Duke of Argile &c. General of Her Majesty's Forces in Spain. This map is most Humbly Dedicated by Herman Moll Geographer. Advertisement: Among all ye cheats that ye world are dayly abus'd with, none have lately been more scandalous than that of maps, some times new ones are put out by ignorant pretenders, some times mean & imperfect forreign maps are copy'd and publish'd by them as their own, and having no judgement or knowledge of what is good or bad, correct or incorrect, they basely impose on the publick with pompous titles, & pretend they are countenanc'd & assisted by those who either never saw, or despise their wretched performances ... Map shows \"Places where battles &c. have been fought by the English mentioned in history.\" Historic Maps copy has ms. annotations."

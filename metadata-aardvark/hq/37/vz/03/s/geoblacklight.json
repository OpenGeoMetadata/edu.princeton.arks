    "This dataset shows the expansions to electric transmission spur lines in the contiguous United States that will be required by 2050 under a net-zero-emissions scenario with 100% renewable energy generation and more permissive land-use assumptions. For an overview of this \"E+RE+\" all-renewable scenario and these \"base\" land-use assumptions, please refer to the \"supplemental information\" portion of this record."

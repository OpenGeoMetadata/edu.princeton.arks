    "The Parcel Regions layer contains polygons depicting the taxable areas of parcels for all of Summit County, Ohio, 2008. The dataset is maintained in an ESRI ARC/INFO LIBRARIAN database. Multiple spatially-identical polygons may exist for parcels where multiple tax rates are applied to the same property. Areas of properties that exist within road right-of-ways are not included in this dataset, as they are not taxed (To determine the legal boundary of any parcel, its recorded survey or legal description should be referenced). Several attribute fields from the Summit County Fiscal Office's CAMA database are included in this dataset."

    "This dataset shows the expansions to electric transmission spur lines in the contiguous United States that will be required by 2050 under a net-zero-emissions scenario with high electrification and more restrictive land-use assumptions. For an overview of this \"E+\" high-electrification scenario and these \"constrained\" land-use assumptions, please refer to the \"supplemental information\" portion of this record."

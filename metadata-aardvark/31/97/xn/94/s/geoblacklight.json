    "Relief shown pictorially. Title cartouche, designed and engraved by N. Guerard, top right. Cartouche with scale of miles and Avertissement, top left. Originally L'Isle lived at the Rue des Canettes prez de St. Sulpice, in Paris; and the first issue of this map bears that location. About 1708 he moved to the address given on this map. Therefore, this map must have been issued in 1708 or later. See Map Collector's Circle, no. 33, p. 6."

    "This dataset shows the wind and solar development in the contiguous United States that will be required by 2050 under a reference scenario projecting no changes in energy policy and under more permissive land-use assumptions. For an overview of this \"REF\" frozen-policy scenario and these \"base\" land-use assumptions, please refer to the \"supplemental information\" portion of this record."

    "This dataset shows the carbon dioxide (CO2) spur pipelines in the contiguous United States that will be required by 2050 to connect CO2 point sources with capture to CO2 trunk pipelines under a net-zero-emissions scenario with high electrification. For an overview of this \"E+\" high-electrification scenario, please refer to the \"supplemental information\" portion of this record."

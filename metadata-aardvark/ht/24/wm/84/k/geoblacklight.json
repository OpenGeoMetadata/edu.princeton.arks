    "Map of Zakynthos Island set in page of text; relief shown pictorially. Appears in the author's L'isole piu famose del mondo, descritte da Thomaso Porcacchi da Castiglione Arretino e intagliate da Girolamo Porro Padovano ..., p. 98. The map appears in various editions of the atlas from 1576 to 1620. In later editions of the atlas the printing plate appears to have deteriorated."

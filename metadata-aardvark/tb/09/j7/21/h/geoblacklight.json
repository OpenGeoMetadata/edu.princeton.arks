    "Hemispherical map on a globular projection; relief shown by hachures. Australia is shown as a single continent labeled \"Nuova Olanda.\" Australia was first circumnavigated and mapped in 1803 by Matthew Flinders, who suggested that the names \"New South Wales\" and \"New Holland\" be abandoned and the name \"Australia\" be given to the region, a suggestion offically adopted after 1817. cf. Scott, E. A short history of Australia. Outline color. Accompanied by: Emisfero occidentale. [Italy? : s.n., 18--?] (HMC01.3608)."

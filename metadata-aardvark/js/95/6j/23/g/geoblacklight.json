The map appears in various editions of the atlas from 1576 to 1620. In later editions of the atlas the printing plate appears to have deteriorated considerably. Map of Naxos Island set in a page of text; relief shown pictorially. Appears to be oriented with north towards bottom. Text in Italian on verso."

    "Relief shown pictorially. Ancillary maps: Insula Minorca ex Balearibus secunda cum castello porto Maon quam Angli jam ab anno 1708. in potestate habent -- Accurata delineatio hispanici castelli Ceuta in ora Africæ siti, quod Maroccenses per 34 annos frustra obsederunt, anno 1727, vero sponte deseruerunt. Includes views: Prospectus celeberrimi portus Cadix in hispanico regno Andalusia -- Prospectus munitissimi castelli Gibraltar in Andalusia hispaniæ regno -- Prospectus urbis Malagæ in hispaniæ regno Granada. Seutter was awarded the title of Imperial Geographer in 1731; the business passed to his son-in-law, Tobias Conrad Lotter, in 1760; cf. Tooley's dict. of mapmakers. From an unidentified edition of Seutter's Atlas novus."

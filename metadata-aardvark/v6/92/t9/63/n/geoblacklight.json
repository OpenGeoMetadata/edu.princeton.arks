    "Land parcels in Lake County, Ohio, 2009. Those portions of the real estate parcel which are considered during appraisal and/or taxation processes. This excludes rights-of-way easements for roads and other, similar circumstances. Note that some real estate parcels are wholly exempt and may not be represented in any manner by a taxable parcel—examples include public utilities, mineral parcels (oil/gas wells), exempt uses, and etc. This corresponds to the “alpha parcel” as described by Assessor’s staff."

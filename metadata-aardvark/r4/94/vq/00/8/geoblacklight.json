    "Map features New Jersey, New York and New England. Relief represented pictorially; depth represented by soundings. The map possibly appeared as early as 1716, and appeared in Homann Heirs atlases to 1784. cf. McCorkle, B. New England in early printed maps. Historic Maps copy 4 has \"Cum privilegio Sac. Cæs. Maj.\" added to cartouche."

    "This dataset shows the wind and solar development in the contiguous United States that will be required by 2050 under a net-zero-emissions scenario with constrained renewable-energy development and more permissive land-use assumptions. For an overview of this \"E+RE-\" renewable-limited scenario and these \"base\" land-use assumptions, please refer to the \"supplemental information\" portion of this record."

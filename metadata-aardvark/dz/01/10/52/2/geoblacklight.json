    "This dataset shows the expansions to bulk electric transmission lines in the contiguous United States that will be required by 2050 to connect spur line connection points (substations that existed in 2019 and had a voltage class rating of 161kV or greater) to metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) under a net-zero-emissions scenario with high electrification and more restrictive land-use assumptions. For an overview of this \"E+\" high-electrification scenario and these \"constrained\" land-use assumptions, please refer to the \"supplemental information\" portion of this record."

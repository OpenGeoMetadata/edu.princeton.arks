    "Scale information on map is incorrect. Scale as determined from bar scale by cataloger is approximately 1:6,000,000. Graphs: Seasonal contribution on rainfall (4,000 BCM) -- Rainfall range based geographical area (328 M Ha) -- Basin-wise water resource potential (BCM) -- Basin-wise replenishable groundwater resources (BCM) -- Basin wise flow & storage potential in India (BCM) -- Culturable command area (M Ha) -- Projected water demand (BCM) -- Basin-wise per capita water availability -- Expenditure on irrigation development vis-a-vis plan expenditure (1993-94 prices) -- Planwise irrigation potential created and utilised (cumulative) -- Live storage capacity of reservioirs (BCM). Includes statistical data on water resources, status of dams and advertisements of water related organizations. Ancillary maps: Proposed inter basin water transfer links -- Basin wise distribution of hydro power potential."

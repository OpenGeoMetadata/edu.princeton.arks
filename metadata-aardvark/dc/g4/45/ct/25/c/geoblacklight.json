The map shows protected forest areas administered by national or regional institutions in the South American Neotropical Pacific Slope coastal corridor,known as \"Chocó Biogeográfico\". It focuses on the pressures these ecosystems face due to the exploitation of natural resources and other human activities, such as agro-industrial production; it highlights the location of conservation units, land ecoregions, roads, and rivers. Locates indigenous and Afrodescendant communities."

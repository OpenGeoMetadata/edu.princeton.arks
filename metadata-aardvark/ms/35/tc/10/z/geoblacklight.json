    "Relief shown pictorially. Re-engraving in smaller size of George Lily map of Great Britain (1546), with a few minor alterations. Orientation is different, i.e., north is at top of map. As this map bears a pontifical privilege, it probably was issued at Rome. Historic Maps copy imperfect: lower right-hand corner wanting."
